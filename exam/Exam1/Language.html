		<h1>Serbian Language</h1>
		<p>Serbian (српски / srpski, pronounced [sr̩̂pskiː]) is the standardized variety of the Serbo-Croatian language mainly used by Serbs. It is the official language of Serbia, co-official in the territory of Kosovo, and one of the three official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In addition, it is a recognized minority language in Montenegro, where it is spoken by the relative majority of the population, as well as in Croatia, North Macedonia, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic.</p>

    <h2>Grammar</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Nouns</li>
            <p>Serbian nouns are classified into three declensional types, denoted largely by their nominative case endings as "-a" type, "-i" and "-e" type. Into each of these declensional types may fall nouns of any of three genders: masculine, feminine or neuter. Each noun may be inflected to represent the noun's grammatical case, of which Serbian has seven:

            Nominative
            Genitive
            Dative
            Accusative
            Vocative
            Instrumental
            Locative

            Nouns are further inflected to represent the noun's number, singular or plural. </p>
        <li>Adjectives</li>
            <p>Adjectives in Serbian may be placed before or after the noun they modify, but must agree in number, gender and case with the modified noun. </p>
        <li>Verbs</li>
            <p>Serbian verbs are conjugated in four past forms—perfect, aorist, imperfect, and pluperfect—of which the last two have a very limited use (imperfect is still used in some dialects, but the majority of native Serbian speakers consider it archaic), one future tense (also known as the first future tense, as opposed to the second future tense or the future exact, which is considered a tense of the conditional mood by some contemporary linguists), and one present tense. These are the tenses of the indicative mood. Apart from the indicative mood, there is also the imperative mood. The conditional mood has two more tenses: the first conditional (commonly used in conditional clauses, both for possible and impossible conditional clauses) and the second conditional (without use in the spoken language—it should be used for impossible conditional clauses). Serbian has active and passive voice. </p>
    </ul>  
    
    <h2>Serbia's Alphabets</h2>
    <p>Serbia has two alphabets: Cyrillic and Latin. Cyrillic is the more formal type of alphabet that is used in Government, but the Latin alphabet is used in daily life such as texting or on store signs. Below is a table of some examples of the differences in letters from English:</p>
    <table style="width:100%">
